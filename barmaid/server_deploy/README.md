Do you like inn enviroment with barmans or barmaids serving you drinks all night long? :beer:

## Code asignment [CZ]:
```
Student napíše Bota pro komunikační platformu Discord, v programovacím jazyce Python.
Student zároveň s tím vyřeší požadavek na hosting Bota pro jej nepřetržitý provoz.
Bot by měl sloužit k obecným potřebám různorodých komunit využívající tuto platformu, 
např. Bot bude zprostředkovávat vytváření a plánování eventů pro uživatele komunity a jejich účasti 
na daném eventu. Dále bude Bot sloužit jako administrátorský nástroj pro administrátora komunity např. 
hromadné mazání a posílání zpráv, hromadné přesouvání uživatelů, a samotné zprostředkování pravidel pro komunitu.
V neposlední řadě bude Bot moci streamovat v tzv. Voice Channels hudbu zadanou odkazem např. ze Spotify, Youtube.
```

## Code asignment [EN]:
```
Student will code a bot for Discord platform in Python language. Student will also resolve it's own hosting.
Bot should be used as a general purpose tool for the variety communities using Discord nowadays.
Should be able to create a event on server and manage it for the server. (Sign in/Sign out of event, logging their attendance).
Next, it should be a tool of some kind for administators on the server, which they can use to mass message everyone on the server, mass member movement, and last but not least - manage the rules for the server.
Lastly, what bot could do is to stream music via Voice Channels on server passed by URL eg. Spotify, Youtube.
```

# To host bot on your own
Make sure your machine's running `Python 3.8+`, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/).


Installing Python for Linux:
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
To quickly check whether you've Python installed:
```
python3 --version
```
To install any requirements needed:
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have `FFmpeg` installed and added to the PATH enviroment variables. You can download it [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).

For Linux its:
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

Visit [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create new application (convert it to bot) there and save it's  `token`. KEEP IT SECRET!

Open `.env-example` file and paste your token here. Rename `.env-example` just to `.env`
```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_goes_here
```


Once again from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) create an invitation link to add your bot to discord servers. Give it `administrator` and select scope to `application.commands`. Copy generated invite link and fill accordingly to config.

Open `config.json` and edit the following `BOT_URL_AUTH_HEADER`, `BOT_INVITE_URL`, `BOT_ID` as follows:
```
{
  "BOT_URL_AUTH_HEADER": "https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id_here_without_bracers}",
  "BOT_INVITE_URL": "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id_here_without_bracers}&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands",
  "BOT_ID": {client_id_here_without_bracers}
}
```
Mainly you just focus on the id itself.

After you're done editting, it's time to run it!
```
python3 barmaid.py
```
For running script on Linux server I suggest you to use `screen` first to make the script running even after your session from server is abandoned. Then you can `Ctrl + A + D` to detach from session before you close [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/).
```
> screen
> python3 barmaid.py
```
For next resuming the previous session after connecting again to server use:
```
screen -r
```

###### Please note that the audio part of bot might not work with some FFmpeg versions when running python 3.8+, to solve this issue, just run the application with python version 3.8 (3.8.10 to be precise, its insalled by default on Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS) directly.

# Use bot with prefix `.` or via slash commands
:heavy_exclamation_mark::heavy_exclamation_mark::heavy_exclamation_mark:It's suggested to use in-app slash commands.:heavy_exclamation_mark::heavy_exclamation_mark::heavy_exclamation_mark:

Example:
```
.ping
>>> Pong! Latency is 1ms.
```
or
```
/ping
>>> Pong! Latency is 1ms.
```
# Rest of configuration file `config.json`
Can look something like this:
```json
{
  "DeleteMessages": {
    "DELETE_COMMAND_INVOKE": 15,
    "DELETE_COMMAND_ERROR": 25,
    "DELETE_EMBED_POST": 300,
    "DELETE_EMBED_HELP": 120
  },
  "Activity": {
    "CLIENT_ACTIVITY": ["Your Barmaid!",
     "Serving drinks!",
      "Local Pub."]
  }
}
```
You can modify this data to your own liking:
- "DELETE_COMMAND_INVOKE" - Regular message (respond to command) until its deletion. *Number: time in seconds.*
- "DELETE_COMMAND_ERROR" - Regular error message (respond to command) until its deletion. *Number: time in seconds.*
- "DELETE_EMBED_POST" - Important message (respond to command, announce etc.) until its deletion. *Number: time in seconds.*
- "DELETE_EMBED_HELP" - Command help message until its deletion. *Number: time in seconds.*
- "CLIENT_ACTIVITY" - Activity bot is showing up as "Playing now". (Cannot be per server.) *List: containing several strings".*
